CI uses 50% tolerance so floors are ~half of observed. max_errors is omitted (null) for all scenarios — errors are expected on a cold CI stack because Kafka publish failures are non-fatal (the app continues serving HTTP). Real throughput baselines enforced locally: bench_baselines.json at 15% tolerance via make bench. Celebrity scenario omitted — its name is dynamic (N-code hot pool) and varies with BENCH_CELEBRITY_POOL_SIZE.",
